<h2>About Brian Taylor, <i>facilitator</i></h2>

<p>Brian has been practicing Zen for many years: in the 1990’s as a student of Joko Beck in San Diego (see her book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001VA1PTI">Everyday Zen</a>); and from 2014–2024 with Taigen Dan Leighton in Chicago (see his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0861716450">Zen Questions</a>). Brian took Buddhist vows as a lay practitioner in 2016. He continues as a student of Hogetsu Laurie Belzer, the Guiding Teacher of <a href="https://www.ancientdragon.org">Ancient Dragon Zen Gate</a> in Chicago, who offers ongoing counsel and guidance to Brian for his facilitation of the Corrales Zen group.</p>

<p>For 30 years, Brian was the senior priest of <a href="https://www.stmichaelsabq.org">St. Michael and All Angels Episcopal Church</a> in the North Valley of Albuquerque. During those years he earned a certificate in Spiritual Direction from the Shalem Institute, founded a Contemplative Center, published four books on contemplative theology and practice, and received an honorary doctorate from his seminary in Berkeley for contributions to the field of spirituality.</p>

<p>Since retirement, Brian has devoted himself fully to Zen study and practice. He lives in Corrales with his wife Susanna.</p>
